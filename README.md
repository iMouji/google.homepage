My First 'Odin Project' Project 

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)


The next assignment of this curriculum is this HTML and CSS project. I will be deconstructing the google.com home_page and rebuilding it. The goal is to both further undestand the structure and placement of HTML tags and their styling using CSS, and to also get further practice with all the skills I have been aquiring throughout the start of this course. 


First step is, which is optional, is to set up a repository for my project on Github.
